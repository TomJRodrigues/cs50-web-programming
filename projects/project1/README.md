# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a book information and review website.

Built with Python, Flask, SQL, Bootstrap, and SASS.

A good exploration into structuring relational databases and SQL queries. Had some fun with using Flask's decorators and using Jinja's conditional HTML rendering. Thanks again to Bootstrap for making styling trivial while I could focus on the backend.

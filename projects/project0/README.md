# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a basic wireframe for a mobile app idea I've been kicking around.

The idea is to provide an easy form service to send a trip plan to your emergency contact before you leave for a wilderness adventure. It prompts you for information needed by search and rescue teams, and it houses it in a nice UI that makes it easy to remember every question every trip.

As for project requirements, this was just a very basic exploration into pure HTML and CSS, dealing with some higher-level Sass techniques like mixins and media queries.

Hopefully you'll see this as a React Native App sometime soon.
